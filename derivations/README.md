# Derivations

## Summary
This directory contains notebooks to show how the design equations for the novel MRI receive coil matching networks were found.
Notebooks are also included to show why other topologies cannot simultaneously yield noise matching, optimal preamplifier decoupling and common-mode rejection.

## Dependencies
The dependencies for the notebooks can be installed with by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in this directory.
The requirements at [https://lcapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html](https://lcapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) must also be installed.

## Contents
- `valid` contains notebooks with derivations for the novel five-element matching networks.
- `invalid` contains notebooks showing that other five-element topologies cannot simultaneously yield noise matching, optimal preamplifier decoupling and common-mode rejection.
